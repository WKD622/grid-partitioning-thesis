    abstract = {A new approximation algorithm for maximum weighted matching in general edge-weighted graphs is presented. It calculates a matching with an edge weight of at least 1/2 of the edge weight of a maximum weighted matching. Its time complexity is O(|E|), with |E| being the number of edges in the graph. This improves over the previously known 1/2 -approximation algorithms for maximum weighted matching which require O(|E| undefined log(|V|)) steps, where |V| is the number of vertices.},

    abstract = "Graph partitioning is an important subproblem in many applications. To solve it efficiently, the multilevel strategy in combination with a matching algorithm and a local refinement heuristic has proven to be a powerful method, and several libraries exist providing such an implementation. Due to the large involvement of heuristics, the evaluation of these libraries is usually based on experiments. In this paper we show that single experiments are usually not sufficient to judge the quality of an algorithm, since even results obtained for graphs of and identical structure show high variations. This is still true, even if the applied algorithms do not contain any nondeterminism. We propose a scheme that considers these variations and therefore makes evaluations and comparisons of different implementations more meaningful. We have applied this technique to evaluate the improvements of the Helpful-Set 2-partitioning implementation and present the obtained results.",

    abstract = {In this paper, we present and study a class of graph partitioning algorithms that reduces the size of the graph by collapsing vertices and edges, we find ak-way partitioning of the smaller graph, and then we uncoarsen and refine it to construct ak-way partitioning for the original graph. These algorithms compute ak-way partitioning of a graphG= (V,E) inO(|E|) time, which is faster by a factor ofO(logk) than previously proposed multilevel recursive bisection algorithms. A key contribution of our work is in finding a high-quality and computationally inexpensive refinement algorithm that can improve upon an initialk-way partitioning. We also study the effectiveness of the overall scheme for a variety of coarsening schemes. We present experimental results on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that this new scheme produces partitions that are of comparable or better quality than those produced by the multilevel bisection algorithm and requires substantially smaller time. Graphs containing up to 450,000 vertices and 3,300,000 edges can be partitioned in 256 domains in less than 40 s on a workstation such as SGI's Challenge. Compared with the widely used multilevel spectral bisection algorithm, our new algorithm is usually two orders of magnitude faster and produces partitions with substantially smaller edge-cut.}

    abstract = {Mapping data to parallel computers aims at minimizing the execution time of the associated application. However, it can take an unacceptable amount of time in comparison with the execution time of the application if the size of the problem is large. In this paper, first we motivate the case for graph contraction as a means for reducing the problem size. We restrict our discussion to applications where the problem domain can be described using a graph (e.g., computational fluid dynamics applications). Then we present a mapping-oriented Parallel Graph Contraction (PGC) heuristic algorithm that yields a smaller representation of the problem to which mapping is then applied. The mapping solution for the original problem is obtained by a straight-forward interpolation. We then present experimental results on using contracted graphs as inputs to two physical optimization methods; namely, Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing. The experimental results show that the PGC algorithm still leads to a reasonably good quality mapping solutions to the original problem, while producing a substantial reduction in mapping time. Finally, we discuss the cost-quality tradeoffs in performing graph contraction.},

    abstract = {In this paper we present a parallel formulation of the multilevel graph partitioning and sparse matrix ordering algorithm. A key feature of our parallel formulation (that distinguishes it from other proposed parallel formulations of multilevel algorithms) is that it partitions the vertices of the graph intopparts while distributing the overall adjacency matrix of the graph among allpprocessors. This mapping results in substantially smaller communication than one-dimensional distribution for graphs with relatively high degree, especially if the graph is randomly distributed among the processors. We also present a parallel algorithm for computing a minimal cover of a bipartite graph which is a key operation for obtaining a small vertex separator that is useful for computing the fill reducing ordering of sparse matrices. Our parallel algorithm achieves a speedup of up to 56 on 128 processors for moderate size problems, further reducing the already moderate serial run time of multilevel schemes. Furthermore, the quality of the produced partitions and orderings are comparable to those produced by the serial multilevel algorithm that has been shown to outperform both spectral partitioning and multiple minimum degree.}

Efficient data structures are used to avoid unnecessary searching for the best cell to move and to minimize unnecessary updating of cells affected by each move.},
