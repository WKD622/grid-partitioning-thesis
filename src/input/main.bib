    abstract = {A new approximation algorithm for maximum weighted matching in general edge-weighted graphs is presented. It calculates a matching with an edge weight of at least 1/2 of the edge weight of a maximum weighted matching. Its time complexity is O(|E|), with |E| being the number of edges in the graph. This improves over the previously known 1/2 -approximation algorithms for maximum weighted matching which require O(|E| undefined log(|V|)) steps, where |V| is the number of vertices.},

    abstract = "Graph partitioning is an important subproblem in many applications. To solve it efficiently, the multilevel strategy in combination with a matching algorithm and a local refinement heuristic has proven to be a powerful method, and several libraries exist providing such an implementation. Due to the large involvement of heuristics, the evaluation of these libraries is usually based on experiments. In this paper we show that single experiments are usually not sufficient to judge the quality of an algorithm, since even results obtained for graphs of and identical structure show high variations. This is still true, even if the applied algorithms do not contain any nondeterminism. We propose a scheme that considers these variations and therefore makes evaluations and comparisons of different implementations more meaningful. We have applied this technique to evaluate the improvements of the Helpful-Set 2-partitioning implementation and present the obtained results.",

    abstract = {In this paper, we present and study a class of graph partitioning algorithms that reduces the size of the graph by collapsing vertices and edges, we find ak-way partitioning of the smaller graph, and then we uncoarsen and refine it to construct ak-way partitioning for the original graph. These algorithms compute ak-way partitioning of a graphG= (V,E) inO(|E|) time, which is faster by a factor ofO(logk) than previously proposed multilevel recursive bisection algorithms. A key contribution of our work is in finding a high-quality and computationally inexpensive refinement algorithm that can improve upon an initialk-way partitioning. We also study the effectiveness of the overall scheme for a variety of coarsening schemes. We present experimental results on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that this new scheme produces partitions that are of comparable or better quality than those produced by the multilevel bisection algorithm and requires substantially smaller time. Graphs containing up to 450,000 vertices and 3,300,000 edges can be partitioned in 256 domains in less than 40 s on a workstation such as SGI's Challenge. Compared with the widely used multilevel spectral bisection algorithm, our new algorithm is usually two orders of magnitude faster and produces partitions with substantially smaller edge-cut.}
